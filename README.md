#Terrain Generator

An old project of mine (2010?) inspired by and emulating [Shamus Young's terrain generator](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=141).

It's been updated to use SDL2 and the generation algorithm's been fixed since I first created it, but it's still not the best example of a terrain generator you could reference. Mainly kept around for posterity.
