#Terrain Generator

An old project of mine (2010?) inspired by and emulating [Shamus Young's terrain generator](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=141). Used SDL 1.2, OpenGL and GLConsole.

Full disclosure: Most likely doesn't compile. Probably full of bugs. Isn't a great example of a terrain generator. I just like to save my old projects.
