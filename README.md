#Terrain Generator

An old project of mine (2010?) inspired by and emulating [Shamus Young's terrain generator](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=141). Requires SDL2, devIL, and GLConsole.

It's been updated to use SDL2 and the generation algorithm's been fixed since I first created it, but it's still not the best example of a terrain generator you could find. It does create some pretty wireframes, though.
